print(L5)

# Ques 1.
# Below we have provided two lists of numbers, L1 and L2. Using zip and list comprehension, create a new list, L3, 
# that sums the two numbers if the number from L1 is greater than 10 and the number from L2 is less than 5. 
# This can be accomplished in one line of code.
L1 = [1, 5, 2, 16, 32, 3, 54, 8, 100]
L2 = [1, 3, 10, 2, 42, 2, 3, 4, 3]
L3 = [x1 + x2 for (x1,x2) in list(zip(L1,L2)) if x1>10 and x2<5]
print(L3)
